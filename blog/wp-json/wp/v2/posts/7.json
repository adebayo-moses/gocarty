This leads to users paying network fees twice, which is not good enough.<\/p>\n<p>Also, the second alternative (previous bitcoin trade process), was to send directly to our already specified bitcoin address, then upload the trade manually for confirmation. This is also not good enough for user experience.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>WHAT CHANGED?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Instead of having to go through a series of manual actions, we have fully automated the process. Now, every bitcoin received to your wallet will be automatically converted to Naira and added to your naira wallet which would be available for withdrawal anytime (We believe you know our withdrawals are instant). The rates are displayed on the bitcoin trade page and bitcoin wallet page.<\/p>\n<p>You will no longer be able to store bitcoins in your Prestmit Wallet. Also, you will no longer be able to send out bitcoins. We believe there are quite a number of wallet options for users willing to store bitcoins, we have decided to strictly focus on customers willing to sell bitcoins, and we have made this process very seamless for customers.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>WHAT DID NOT CHANGE?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Your bitcoin address is still the same<\/li>\n<li>The bitcoin receiving process is still the same<\/li>\n<li>You can still use your QR code as always.<\/li>\n<li>You can still receive bitcoins to your wallet from anywhere<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Feel free to <a href=\"https:\/\/prestmit.com\/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contact Prestmit<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>DO YOU NEED A DETAILED TUTORIAL ON THE NEW FEATURE?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div class=\"card border-0 rounded mb-2\">\n<div id=\"collapseelevent\" class=\"collapse show\" aria-labelledby=\"headingeleven\" data-parent=\"#accordionExamplethree\">\n<div class=\"card-body px-2 py-4\">\n<p class=\"text-muted mb-0 faq-ans\">If you need a quick guide on how to sell bitcoins on Prestmit, in this guide, we have explained in detail.
